# Hotel Management System

### Notes

Hotel Management System written in C programming Language was a school project, goal was to create a system for hotels with two types of users (Single Admin and dynamic Users) and use static files to handle data.

### Installation & Usage

[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) has a very good installation guide for compilers for all Opreating Systems.

You can create accouts for guests, but for admin in Welcome Menu type `admin` and it will navigate you to login page, use `admin` as a username and `pass` as a password to login.
